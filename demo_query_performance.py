The raster grid approach provides:
‚úì O(1) query time - constant time lookups
‚úì Simple implementation - just a 2D array
‚úì Memory efficient - ~360KB for 600x600 canvas
‚úì Perfect accuracy within grid resolution
‚úì Scalable - query time independent of number of sites
‚úì Production-ready - used in real GIS and navigation systems

Perfect for applications requiring frequent queries like:
‚Ä¢ GPS navigation systems
‚Ä¢ Emergency service dispatch
‚Ä¢ Facility location services
‚Ä¢ Geographic information systems
‚Ä¢ Game development (AI pathfinding)
